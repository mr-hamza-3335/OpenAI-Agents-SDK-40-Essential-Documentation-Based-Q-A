# OpenAI-Agents-SDK-40-Essential-Documentation-Based-Q-A 
Prepared by: Ameer HamzaRoll No: 404642Class: Saturday EveningEmail: ameerhamza94572@gmail.com

ᵍ Introduction

This document contains my research-based answers to important foundational and intermediate-level questions related to the OpenAI Agents SDK. The goal of this self-assigned exercise was to explore the official documentation thoroughly and solidify my understanding of the key components, behaviors, and tools provided by the SDK.

Each answer is based directly on concepts found in the official documentation and real use cases, not from ChatGPT. The intention is to develop hands-on understanding that will help in future implementation of agentic workflows and collaborative tool-based AI systems.

✅ Questions & Answers

What’s the main advantage of custom tool behavior functions?They provide fine-grained control over how and when tools are invoked during an agent run.

Which method is used to execute an agent asynchronously?await runner.run()

What’s the purpose of RunContextWrapper?It wraps the run context to allow dynamic access and mutation of internal agent state.

What does Runner.run_sync() do?Executes the agent in a synchronous (blocking) manner.

What does extra="forbid" do in a Pydantic model config?It prevents any extra fields that are not defined in the model schema.

What's the main advantage of strict schemas over non-strict?They prevent schema drift and enforce predictable input/output.

What happens when you combine StopAtTools with multiple tool names?The agent run stops once any of the specified tools are invoked.

What is the purpose of context in the OpenAI Agents SDK?It stores shared memory or state between tools, messages, and agent runs.

What's the key consideration when choosing between different tool_use_behavior modes?Balance between performance and flexibility.

What information does handoff_description provide?A short description of what the tool does or expects.

What does ToolsToFinalOutputResult.is_final_output indicate?Whether the agent should stop and return the result as final output.

What’s the difference between hosted tools and function tools in terms of tool_use_behavior?Function tools are local functions, hosted tools are external services.

How do you convert an agent into a tool for other agents?Wrap the agent using as_tool().

What method returns all tools available to an agent?agent.tools

What is the first parameter of every function tool?context

What is the purpose of the get_system_prompt() method?It returns the system-level instruction string.

What’s the difference between InputGuardrail and OutputGuardrail?InputGuardrail filters inputs; OutputGuardrail validates outputs.

What is the primary purpose of the instructions parameter in an Agent?To guide the agent’s overall behavior via system prompt.

What does the reset_tool_choice parameter control?Allows re-selection of tools after a run step.

What happens if a function tool raises an exception?It's captured in logs and can be handled or retried.

What does the clone() method do?Creates a deep copy of the agent or runner.

What is ToolsToFinalOutputFunction in the OpenAI Agents SDK?A function that converts tool results into final output.

What is the return type of Runner.run()?AgentRunResult

What happens if a custom tool behavior function returns is_final_output=False?The agent continues reasoning and may call more tools.

When would you use StopAtTools instead of stop_on_first_tool?When you want to stop on specific tools, not just the first one.

What is the default value for tool_use_behavior in an Agent?auto

What’s the key difference between run_llm_again and stop_on_first_tool in terms of performance?stop_on_first_tool is faster but less flexible.

Which Pydantic v2 decorator is used for field validation?@field_validator

What is the purpose of model_settings in an Agent?To configure generation parameters like temperature.

How do you enable non-strict mode for flexible schemas?Use extra="allow" or ConfigDict(extra="allow")

What does the handoff_description parameter do?Describes the tool's purpose during a handoff.

How do you implement schema evolution while maintaining backward compatibility?Use optional fields and set defaults for new ones.

Can dynamic instructions be async functions?Yes.

What happens when tool_use_behavior is set to 'stop_on_first_tool'?The agent stops reasoning right after the first tool call.

What’s the difference between mutable and immutable context patterns?Mutable allows in-place updates; immutable does not.

What causes the error 'additionalProperties should not be set for object types'?The schema is strict but received unknown fields.

When should you use non-strict schemas over strict schemas?When dealing with dynamic or evolving input.

In a custom tool behavior function, what parameters does it receive?tools, step, context, tool_call_args

What does Runner.run_streamed() return?An async generator yielding real-time outputs.

How do you create dynamic instructions that change based on context?Use a (async) function as instructions that reads from context.
